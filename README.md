**Taxi Cancellation Prediction: A Data Science Approach**

*Objective*
The goal is to predict whether a taxi booking will be canceled before the pickup time. Accurate predictions enable ride-hailing platforms to optimize driver allocation, reduce idle time, and enhance customer satisfaction.

*Tools & Technologies*
Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Model Interpretation: SHAP
Data Sources: Kaggle datasets, OpenStreetCab dataset

*Dataset Overview*
A commonly used dataset for this task is the YourCabs dataset, which includes:
Features: Pickup location, booking time, driver ID, trip duration, and more.
Target Variable: car_cancellation (1 = canceled, 0 = not canceled).
This dataset comprises 10,000 bookings with 19 variables. ​

*Data Preprocessing*
Handle Missing Values: Impute or remove missing data to ensure model accuracy.
Convert Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding for variables like pickup_point and driver_id.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as booking_window (time between booking and pickup).
Balance the Dataset: Apply techniques like SMOTE to address class imbalance.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
Cancellation Rate by Pickup Location: Identify if certain areas have higher cancellation rates.
Cancellation by Time of Day: Analyze patterns in cancellations during different times.
Cancellation by Day of Week: Determine if specific days exhibit higher cancellation rates.

*Model Development*
Model Selection: Test various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Evaluation Metrics: Use metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Model Tuning: Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.​

*Model Interpretation*
Utilize SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions and understand the impact of each feature on the cancellation probability.

*Visualization*
Cancellation Heatmaps: Visualize cancellations across different regions and times.
Feature Importance Plots: Highlight which features most influence the cancellation prediction.​
